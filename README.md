# Iris Flower Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors

This project demonstrates a simple Iris flower classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The Iris dataset from scikit-learn is used for this task.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify different species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Data

The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:** The Iris dataset is loaded and converted to a pandas DataFrame for easy exploration.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Pair plots are used to visualize the relationships between different features and identify patterns for classification.
3. **Data Splitting:** The data is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
4. **Model Building:** A KNN model is created and trained using the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The model's accuracy is calculated using the test data.
6. **Model Testing with New Data:** The trained model is tested with new hypothetical data to demonstrate its classification capabilities.

## Why KNN?

KNN is a good choice for this project due to:

- **Simplicity:** It's easy to understand and implement.
- **Suitability for small datasets:** The Iris dataset has a limited number of samples, which KNN handles efficiently.
- **Interpretability:** The results are easy to understand.
- **Clear separation of flower types:** The Iris dataset features allow for relatively straightforward classification.
- **Easy hyperparameter tuning:** The value of 'k' can be adjusted for optimal performance.
- **No distributional assumptions:** KNN does not require assumptions about data distribution.

## Alternative Algorithms and Why Not?

- **Decision Tree:** Could be a good option, but might overfit on small datasets without proper tuning.
- **Logistic Regression:** Effective for classification, but less suitable for non-linear data.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine):** Performs well on clearly separable data, but can be resource-intensive for small datasets.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a successful implementation of KNN for Iris flower classification. The model achieves a high accuracy in classifying different species based on the provided features. KNN's simplicity and effectiveness make it a valuable tool for such classification tasks.
